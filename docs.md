## Development and Splice Length Calculator for Deformed Bars as per ACI 318-19 (Imperial)

Calculate the development and splice length of deformed rebars for a rebar `fy` and concrete strength `f'c`. Generate detailed development and splice length calculation for a specific rebar diameter.

This tool is limited to imperial units only. Note that the calculator will calculate and round up the coefficient of each value that will be multiplied to the rebar diameter `db`. Moreover, upon multiplying the coefficient with `db`, the result will be then rounded up to the nearest whole number (in in.).

## How to Use this Calculator

Step 1: Specify material strength (fy and fc) at the left menu
