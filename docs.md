## Development and Splice Length Calculator for Deformed Bars as per ACI 318-19 (Imperial)

Calculate the development and splice length of deformed rebars for a rebar `fy` and concrete strength `f'c`. Generate detailed development and splice length calculation for a specific rebar diameter.

This tool is limited to imperial units only.

## How to Use this Calculator

Step 1: Specify material strength (fy and fc) at the left menu
